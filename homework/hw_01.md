1. ### **Central Limit Theorem**:
    - Given a set of identically distributed random variables with known means and variances, derive the Central Limit Theorem and explain its significance.



2. ### **Dice Roll and CLT**:
    - If you roll a fair six-sided die 1000 times, what is the approximate distribution of the sum of the rolls? Explain using the Central Limit Theorem.

3. ### **Loaded Dice**:
    - Suppose a die is loaded such that it's twice as likely to show a 6 than any other single number. Derive the expected value and variance for a single roll. What would be the approximate distribution if you roll this die 500 times and take the sum?

4. ### **Heat Equation**:
    - Derive the Gaussian distribution from the one-dimensional heat equation. Hint: Consider a rod of unit length. What does the distribution of heat look like over time?

5. ### **Covariance and Variance**:
    - Given a set of two-dimensional data points, compute the variance in each dimension and the covariance between the two dimensions. What does the covariance tell you about the relationship between the two dimensions?

6. ### **Multivariate Gaussian Distribution**:
    - Derive the equation for the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Specifically, how does the determinant of the covariance matrix influence the distribution?

7. ### **Empirical Distribution**:
    - Given a dataset, construct its empirical distribution. How does this distribution change as more data is added?

8. ### **Dirac Delta and Empirical Distribution**:
    - Explain how the Dirac delta function can be used to represent an empirical distribution. How does this relate to the concept of a histogram?

9. ### **Mixture Models**:
    - Suppose you have data that appears to be drawn from two different Gaussian distributions. How would you model this data using a Gaussian mixture model? How would you estimate the parameters of this model?

10. ### **Latent Variable and Mixture Models**:
    - Explain the concept of a latent variable in the context of mixture models. How does this latent variable relate to the mixing coefficients?

11. ### **Multinoulli Distribution**:
    - Derive the entropy of a multinoulli distribution. What does this entropy represent in terms of the unpredictability of the distribution?

12. ### **Exponential Distribution in Memorylessness**:
    - Show that the exponential distribution is memoryless. What are the implications of this property?

13. ### **Laplace Distribution**:
    - Given a set of data, show how one would determine if the underlying distribution is more likely to be Gaussian or Laplace. Consider the concept of kurtosis.

14. ### **Comparing Distributions**:
    - How is the Gaussian distribution different from the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions? Provide situations where each would be the most appropriate to use.

15. ### **Covariance Matrix**:
    - For a given dataset, compute its covariance matrix. Then determine if it's a diagonal or isotropic matrix. If it's neither, how might you modify the dataset so the covariance is one of these special cases?

Working through these problems should help solidify your understanding of the probability concepts we've discussed today. Remember to always reflect on the deeper meaning and implications of your solutions.
